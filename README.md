## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains the **solved version of an academic assignment** given in the course
**Software Testing & Quality Assurance (CSE 4495)**.

The assignment was provided by the course instructor, and **this project was solved collaboratively by me and my teammate** as part of the course requirement.

The work includes:

* Unit test implementation
* Defect identification
* System behavior analysis
* Documentation of issues and fixes

✅ **All code, testing, and analysis in this repository were completed by our team.**

---

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives

The main objectives of this assignment were to:

* Apply **unit testing using JUnit**
* Identify **logical and runtime defects**
* Analyze **real-world business logic**
* Understand **software quality assurance practices**
* Improve debugging and testing skills

---

## 🧠 What We Solved in This Project

✔ Implemented all required unit tests
✔ Executed test cases for all modules
✔ Identified intentional and logical defects
✔ Verified booking, wallet, and slot logic
✔ Documented issues and expected behavior
✔ Successfully completed the assignment as a team

## 🧩 System Components

| Component         | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Wallet**        | Manages balance and transactions     |
| **Vehicle**       | Represents a vehicle                 |
| **ParkingSlot**   | Represents parking spaces            |
| **Booking**       | Handles booking lifecycle            |
| **ParkingSystem** | Core system controller               |
| **Enums**         | VehicleType, SlotType, BookingStatus |

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. Vehicle requests a parking slot
2. System validates:

   * Time range
   * Slot availability
   * Vehicle compatibility
3. Booking is created
4. Payment is deducted
5. Booking is either:

   * **Completed** → Slot owner receives payment
   * **Cancelled** → Partial refund is issued

---

## 💰 Pricing Logic

```
Price = Duration × Base Rate × Vehicle Multiplier × Slot Multiplier
```

### Vehicle Pricing

| Vehicle    | Multiplier                    |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Bicycle    | 0.2                           |
| Motorcycle | 0.5                           |
| Car        | 1.0                           |
| Microcar   | ❌ Missing (Defect Identified) |
| Bus        | 2.0                           |
| Truck      | 3.0                           |

## 🧪 Testing Summary

### ✅ Successfully Tested

* Wallet operations
* Booking creation
* Slot availability
* Time validation
* Booking completion
* Cancellation logic

### ❌ Defects Identified

* Missing null validation
* Negative values allowed
* Zero-amount booking accepted
* Missing MICROCAR pricing
* Booking state violations
* Weak exception handling

> These defects were **intentionally identified and documented as part of the assignment solution.**
